## Full changelog of version 1.1.5:

### Added
- Project palettes have been implemented, with undo/redo support! [#1335](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1335)
- Implemented loading Krita (`.kra`) files with animation support. Only projects using RGBA with 8-bit color depth are supported at the moment.
- Loading animations from Photoshop (`.psd`) files is now possible.
- Loading palettes from Aseprite (`.ase`/`.aseprite`) files is now possible.
- Implemented loading Piskel (`.piskel`) files with animation support.
- Added a zoom parameter to the offset shader. [#1330](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1330)
- The currently selected frame & layer are now remembered inside `.pxo` files.
- Added an option to transform content in Modify selection. [#1309](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1309)
- Relative paths are now supported in the CLI. [#1326](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1326)

### Changed
- Bumped extensions API version to 7.
- When clicking on the remove layer button, now all selected layers get removed. This is consistent with how frames get deleted, and is what users would expect.
- During animation playback on frames of a tag, if the user changes to a frame of a different tag, then the frames of that tag are being played. [#1311](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1311)
- Using the move tool on a tilemap layer while draw tiles mode is active now clears the selection, if there is any. [#1340](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1340)
- Current frame & layer are used as default values when importing an image as a new frame, new layer or to replace a cel.

### Fixed
- The bucket tool's flood fill has been further optimized. [#1306](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1306)
- Creating rectangular selections now snap to the grid correctly, if snapping is enabled. [#1338](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1338)
- Pasted selections now get snapped to grid. [#1340](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1340)
- Pasting a selection on a tilemap layer while draw tiles mode is active now updates the tileset. [#1340](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1340)
- Backups no longer appear in the recent project list. [#1341](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1341)
- The names of the projects are no longer being translated in tabs. [#1334](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1334)
- Fixed the drop shadow dialog not having a selected option by default for the affect option button.
