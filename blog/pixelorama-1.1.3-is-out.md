Pixelorama v1.1.3 is here! ðŸŽ‰ Mostly a maintenance release, containing a lot of important bug fixes, but it also comes with a few new features. The most significant change in this update is the fact that the tilemap layer system has been refactored behind the scenes, which affects the behavior of isometric tiles. **Make sure to keep backups of your old projects if they contain isometric tiles.**
