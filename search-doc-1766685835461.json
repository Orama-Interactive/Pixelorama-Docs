While .pxo files from previous versions (from v0.8 to v0.11.4) can be loaded in v1.0, the opposite is not true, .pxo files exported from v1.0 CANNOT be imported to older versions.Due to security concerns for .tres files, palettes made in older versions CANNOT be opened in version 1.0. Version 1.0 uses .json files for palettes instead. However, starting with version 0.11.4, you can export your palettes as image files, which can later be imported by version 1.0 as palettes.Extensions made for Pixelorama v1.0 will not work for previous versions, and extensions made for Pixelorama v0.x will also not work for v1.0. This is due to the fact that 0.x versions use Godot 3, while 1.0 uses Godot 4.For the same reason as above, custom shortcut profiles made for v1.0 will not work for previous versions, and vice versa.While user interface layouts are technically compatible between 0.x and 1.0 versions, it's recommended to remove the old layouts (if you have made any) and make them again in v1.0, as they may not appear correctly, due to the fact that v1.0 has new panels.

Note that group blending is not currently supported. #911Non-destructive layer effects have been implemented. #940A new curve tool has been implemented. It contains a &quot;fill shape&quot; tool option, allowing it to be used as a polygon tool as well. #1019Pixelorama is now available on Steam!. Consider purchasing on Steam as a way to support the development of the project, and getting benefits such as automatic updates and even Steam Achievements!An extension explorer has been integrated into Pixelorama, allowing for easy extension downloading from the internet. #910Export to video formats. FFMPEG is required to be installed in the device in order for video exporting to work. #980Importing video formats and gif files is also possible, but FFMPEG is again required for this.Basic clipping mask functionality has been implemented. Enabling clipping mask on a layer will use the layer directly below it as the mask. Note that right now group layers cannot be used as masks.Alpha lock has been added as a global tool option. When enabled, users can only draw on non-transparent pixels.Export to webp and jpeg file formats. Webp is currently only for static images and does not support animations.A basic Command Line Interface has been implemented, to help with automating mass project file exporting. #579A 64-bit ARM build is now also available along with the 32-bit ARM build.Dragging and dropping multiple frames or layers to re-arrange them is now (finally!) supported, instead of only moving the last layer/frame selected.Users can now create new tags from the frame right-click menu, by clicking on &quot;New Tag&quot;.It is now possible to edit a tag's properties by clicking on its name from the timeline, and to move and resize it by dragging its edges.Users can now resize the timeline's cel size from the timeline settings, which used to be onion skinning settings.Exporting the project's data to a separate JSON file is now possible from the export dialog.Native file dialogs are now supported and can be enabled from the Preferences!Dialog popups can now be native OS windows instead of embedded within Pixelorama's main window. This can be changed from the Preferences.Added some missing shortcuts for buttons. #900Palette colors can now be sorted.Added new Pixelize and Palettize effects. Pixelize makes the image pixelated, and Palettize maps the color of the input to the nearest color in the selected palette. Useful for limiting color in pixel art and for artistic effects. Can also act as a workaround for the current lack of a proper indexed mode.Exporting each layer as a different file is now possible.The bucket tool now supports filling while the mouse is moving and the button is still being held.A new boot splash image is being shown when Pixelorama is loading, instead of a gray color.The brush increment/decrement shortcuts can now be changed. #900Changing layers is now possible with keyboard shortcuts (Control + Up/Down arrow keys by default).A &quot;Crop to Selection&quot; option has been added to the Image menu, that crops the image based on the active selection.A stabilizer for smoother drawing has been implemented.Users can now add custom data in the form of text in their projects, layers, frames, tags and cels.Image brushes can now be flipped and rotated with 90 degree steps in the tool options. #988Added support for inverted tablet pens. #966Added new dialogs for cel, layer and project properties. Cel and layer which can be accessed by right-clicking cel and the layer buttons in the timeline respectively, while project properties can be found under the Image menu.A new z-index property has been added to the cel properties, allowing for independent, per-frame layer ordering.Dragging and dropping images directly from a Web browser into Pixelorama is now possible! Note that this may not work with all browsers.Pasting tags from other projects is now possible. #946A new &quot;Pixelorama&quot; palette has been added to the default palettes.Control + Shift + T has been added as a default shortcut that opens the last project.Imported .gpl palettes now take into account their &quot;Columns&quot; field. #1025&quot;Snap to&quot; settings from the View menu are now being remembered between sessions.The step of the zoom and rotation canvas sliders can now be snapped, to 100 and 45 respectively.It is now possible to change the color space of gradients from sRGB, which is the default, to Linear sRGB and Oklab.3D layers now support torus shapes. #900Image effect animation now supports the tweening transition method of spring. #900Added a new Rose theme.

Pxo files are now zip files in disguise. #952Similarly, the file format of Pixelorama's palette files has been changed from .tres back to .json as they used to be in the past. This change had to happen due to security concerns regarding Godot's resource files. #967Changes made to the User Interface layouts are now automatically being saved. To restore a default layout, users can go to Window &gt; Manage Layouts &gt; Add and select from one of the default layouts.Pixelorama's icon has changed.The config file has been renamed from &quot;cache.ini&quot; to &quot;config.ini&quot;. This effectively means that preferences edited in v0.x will not be automatically be carried over to v1.0.The colors of the themes has been limited and grouped to allow for easier theming, using this new stand-alone tool.The color picker is now always visible in the user interface as its own panel, instead of being a popup. The previous color buttons have been re-purposed to allow for setting whether the color being selected is for the left or the right tool.The color pickers has been vastly improved, thanks to the update to Godot 4. Users can now use the OKHSL color mode, and choose between four different picker shapes: HSV Rectangle (default), HSV Wheel, VHS Circle and OKHSL Circle.The opacity slider in the timeline now affects layer opacity and not cel opacity. Cel opacity has been moved to the cel properties dialog.Bucket tool's &quot;similar colors&quot; mode now changes the same color in all selected cels, acting as a color replace for multiple cels.The timeline's UI has been changed to better indicate which cels are selected and improves on how child layers of groups are being shown.The onion skinning settings has been changed into general timeline settings.Cel-specific effects have been moved from the Image menu into the new Effects menu.Linked cels no longer have a colored outline, they now have a rectangle behind their preview which makes linked cels look like they are chained together.&quot;Crop Image&quot; has been renamed to &quot;Crop to Content&quot;.Imported images automatically become new projects without opening the import dialog, if there is only one project open, and that project is empty.Window opacity is disabled by default to improve performance, but it can be enabled in the Preferences.Reference images have received some nice improvements, including undo/redo and easy transformations directly on the canvas. #961The add/remove swatch color buttons have been moved to the same horizontal container as the palette select and add/edit palette buttons, allowing for Inkscape-like horizontal placement of the palette panel, without any wasted space.Cel buttons now hide their transparent background when their corresponding cels are empty, instead of just dimming them.Every shader-based image effect is automatically working without the need to change renderers, and they all work now on the Web version. This comes at the cost of less compatibility, as the desktop version now requires OpenGL 3.3 minimum instead of 2.1, and the Web version requires WebGL 2 instead of WebGL 1. #900The dynamics popup only show the relevant properties to which dynamics are currently toggled on.When attempting to enable an extension, a confirmation dialog appears, as an extra security step.The aspect ratio button in the Scale Image dialog is toggled on by default.Negative values in shading tool options are now allowed. #1015If &quot;Include frame tags in the file name&quot; is enabled in the export window, the tag name is included even when exporting a single file.When deleting an extension, a confirmation window now appears that lets users either to delete the palette permanently, move it to trash, or cancel. #919&quot;Developers&quot; and &quot;Contributors&quot; have been merged into &quot;Authors&quot; in the About dialog. &quot;Donate&quot; has also been removed from there, and a new &quot;Support Pixelorama's Development&quot; option has been added to the Help menu.

This prevents behaviors such as switching the focus of GUI elements with, for example, the arrow keys while moving the canvas or an active selection with the arrow keys.The canvas no longer remains in the drag state when the mouse it outside of it. Meaning, if the middle mouse button or space is being pressed to drag the canvas, and the mouse gets out of the canvas while the button is still pressed and then it is released, when the mouse re-enters the canvas, it is no longer being dragged.Pixelorama no longer quits when saving from the File menu, if the user attempted to save on exit before and cancelled the save file dialog.The delete layer button is now immediately disabled when locking a layer, thus preventing the user from being able to delete a locked layer.Fixed a bug where the exported files had the wrong tag name, if &quot;Include frame tags in the file name&quot; was enabled.The text of the rulers is now being properly clipped. #1023  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Removed​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Pixelorama v1.0 is finally out!","url":"/blog/pixelorama-1.0-is-out#removed","content":" BubbleGum16, Complementary, Monochromatic, Shades and Triad palettes have been removed from the default palettes.The frame tag button has been removed from the timeline.It is no longer possible to change the renderer from the Preferences, as GLES3 is now the only option.

Here are some ideas that I have for future versions. Note that it's not 100% certain when and if these will be implemented, but I will do my best!  Indexed mode.Tilemap layers.Vector layers, for non-destructive shape editing and text editing.An Android version.Animated layer effects, with support for custom shader loading.A more powerful brush system, perhaps giving the ability for users to create their own code-based brushes instead of just images.More love for the 3D layers, such as the ability to edit an object's material, and load and export GLTF files.Performance improvements, especially for operations that affect a large number of pixels. Some of the algorithms we use may have to be re-written in C++.The ability to rotate and skew selections directly with gizmos.Make the shading tool have a mode that takes darker and lighter colors from the palette.Color curves and brightness/contrast adjusting.Save gradients so that they can be re-used easily, and give the options to users to add their own dithering matrices.

The way it currently works is that before we release a new major version, such as 1.0 and 1.1, we announce a time period (usually around a month) where everyone can draw an artwork made with Pixelorama, and they can submit it to the #pixelorama-splash-screen channel in our Discord server. This causes problems where some artists may be unavailable to work on an artwork at that time, and it also causes problems for us because the event creates an extra delay to major releases, as it is an important factor we have to take into account before a new major version.  Going forward, we are going to get rid of the time limit and allow everyone to submit artworks for the next major version whenever they want. This essentially means that you can submit an artwork for the next major version, which will be 1.2, right now. This is true for every major release from now on. The moment a new major version is out, we will start accepting entries for the next major version.  We do not have a release date for v1.2, so you will have to wait for a while before seeing it in Pixelorama. However, we believe that this new system will be beneficial for everyone, as it is more asynchronous. If you prefer the old system, you have nothing to worry about, as we will still put out an announcement before releasing a new major version to remind you to participate in the event.  If you are interested, you can join our Discord server, where the event takes place. We have added a new role for people who are interested in receiving updates for the event, so make sure to grab it from &quot;Channels &amp; Roles&quot;. We hope to see a lot more entries for v1.2, and we can't wait to see what you create!

All that (and so many more!) in the span of just 8 months! But, of course, there is still so much more to be done, and we will keep needing your support in order to implement these new features. These are my current plans, in no particular order:  An effect graph which will let users create effects directly within Pixelorama itself.An Android version.Vector layers, for non-destructive shape editing and text editing.The ability to rotate and skew selections directly with gizmos.Autotiling for tilemap layers.Even more tools, such as a gradient tool.Support for skeletal, bone-based 2D animation system.A more powerful brush system, perhaps giving the ability for users to create their own code-based brushes instead of just images.Better compatibility with other software, such as exporting directly to Godot nodes and resources in the form on AnimationPlayer, AnimatedSprite, TileSet and TileMapLayer, etc.More love for the 3D layers, such as the ability to edit an object's material, and load and export GLTF files.Performance improvements, especially for operations that affect a large number of pixels.

I am happy to announce that I've done progress on this front, and today we are releasing the first ever Android version. You can get it for free, currently only on itch.io: https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama  Please keep in mind that this version is still experimental, so please think of it as very early access and not something that is production ready. It has not been widely tested as of this moment, so please do not use it for any serious work. While it should work fine, the user interface is not very mobile-friendly at the moment. This is why I recommend you to use it if you have an Android tablet and not a phone, as the experience on smaller screens will not be quite as enjoyable. We rely on user feedback to improve Pixelorama, so if you do use the Android version, we are looking forward to your thoughts and ideas! The next steps would be to polish it further by adding buttons for quickly undoing and redoing, and perhaps UI buttons for the Shift, Control and Alt modifiers, like the Android version of Godot has. Once we're more confident of its quality, we will publish it to places like F-Store, and eventually Google Play.  We will mostly focus on improving the tablet experience for now, as adapting the interface to tablets is easier than on mobile phones. Eventually, however, we may have to make an entirely different version of the UI that will be enabled by default on phones, that is simpler and less crowded, with bigger buttons that are easier to interact with on small screens. Users will always have the option to switch back and forth between UI modes, no matter the platform. This is what Clip Studio Paint also does, and I think it may be the best approach to tackle this issue. No promises as to when this will happen though, as it would be quite a large undertaking.  To accompany the Android version, a new single tool mode has been added! This essentially makes the right mouse button no longer be able to have a tool of its own, and it always activates the same tool as the left mouse button. On touch screens, the left mouse button is equivalent to tapping the screen, and the right mouse button is equivalent to long presses. The single tool mode is enabled by default on Android and disabled on other platforms, but you can toggle it from the preferences, no matter which device you're using!

This means that the pixels do not have their own independent color values. Instead, they get their color from the palette, depending on the index number they contain. This essentially means that if a pixel contains the number &quot;3&quot;, its color will be the same as the 3rd color of the currently selected palette. Changing that color in the palette, or even switching to a new palette, will change all of the colors of the image that are also mapped to the 3rd palette color. Re-ordering the colors of the palette also affect the image. If the 3rd color in the palette is a blue color and the 4th is a green one, moving the green one into the 3rd spot, will make all of the previously blue pixels of the image green, as they will remain mapped to the 3rd color of the palette, whatever that is.  To change the color of the pixels, simply pick the color you want from the palette, and use a drawing tool on the pixels you want. If you freely select a color from the color picker, it will not be applied to the image. Instead, Pixelorama will automatically find the closest color from the currently active palette, and apply that instead.

The image-based brushes are also divided into two types, File brushes and Project brushes. File brushes are stored as external .png files, while project brushes are stored in the project itself. File brushes can also be Random brushes. Each time you draw using a random brush, the result will be something different!  Image-based brushes will also have one extra option in the tool settings; a &quot;Brush Color From&quot; slider which goes from 0 to 100. If it's set to 0, the resulting color(s) of the brush will come entirely from the image data themselves. Otherwise, if set to 100, the brush color will come from the currently selected color.

It contains a data.json file, and an image_data folder. The data.json file contains all of the project's metadata, such as project name, size, FPS, and the metadata of layers, frames, cels, etc. They are stored in JSON form, so they can easily be read by other software, such as custom tools or game engine plugins.  The image_data folder contains all of the image data. It contains another folder called frames, which in turn contains a folder for each frame of the project, and each frame folder contains the image data of every cel that belongs to that frame. To preserve a non-destructive workflow, the cel image data are not affected by layer blend modes and layer effects. Along with the image data themselves, the data of the indices of each pixel are also being stored in the form of images. The files of these names start with indices_, and they are needed for indexed mode.  If you have enabled the option to include the blended images, the image_data folder will also contain all of the final image data for each frame. A final image is composed of every cel, with the layer effects applied to each cel, blended together into a single image, taking the blend modes of each layer into account.  If the project has brushes, a brushes folder is also created, containing all of the brush image data. Similarly, if the project contains tilemap layers, the tilesets that they use are being stored in a tilesets folder. Each tileset has its own folder, named after its index, and the folders contain the individual tiles in the form of image data. If the project contains audio layers, the audio files of these layers are being stored in an audio folder.  In order for a software to read the data of a pxo, it has to open it as a zip file, and then it has to read the data.json file, and parse it as JSON object. Then, it either has to loop through the all of the folders included in image_data/frames, where each folder contains the cel data for each frame separately, or, if the final blended images are included and that's all we care about, it just has to loop through all of the images inside the image_data folder, where each image corresponds to every frame of the project, and import them.

If we started Pixelorama using plain C++ or something like that it would be much more primitive and the development would be a lot slower. Features such as the image and layer effects, 3D layers, the extension system and others would be a lot harder to implement without Godot. Most of the community came from Godot, so if Godot wasn't used, it would also be less popular and it would have less contributors, leading to even less features and polish. Godot handles a lot of stuff for us already behind the scenes, and pretty much most major Godot releases also bring visible improvements to Pixelorama without us having to do big changes. Having to do all of that from scratch would be exhausting.  Pixelorama started as an experiment to see if making such a software in Godot is possible. The first time we showed it to Godot's community, we mostly did it to show what we could do with Godot, We weren't expecting anyone to actually use it, but we did want to make a proper pixel art software so we decided to keep improving it so it would become usable.

So if you draw a pixel two pixels from the left of the vertical symmetry line and horizontal symmetry is enabled, then the pixel two pixels from the right of the symmetry line and on the same vertical position will also get drawn.

The moved pixels can optionally be wrapped around when they go out of bounds. For example, if a pixel leaves the canvas from the right, it re-appears on the left side. Mirror\tMirrors the content of the image horizontally, vertically or both. Rotate\tRotates the content of the image. Can change the angle, the pivot point, as well as the algorithm. There are seven rotation algorithms to choose from: Rotxel with Smear, cleanEdge, OmniScale, Nearest Neighbor (Shader), Nearest Neighbor, Rotxel and &quot;Upscale, Rotate and Downscale&quot;. The first four are shader-based, meaning that they use the GPU, while the rest use the CPU. The algorithms that use the GPU tend to be faster. Rotxel with Smear can also create a smearing effect. Invert colors\tInverts the colors of the image. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. Desaturation\tDesaturates the colors of the image, turning them to grayscale. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. Adjust Hue/Saturation/Value\tAdjusts the hue, saturation and the value of the image's colors. Adjust Brightness/Contrast\tAdjusts the brightness, contrast, and even the saturation, RGB values and tint color of the image's colors. Color Curves\tAdjusts the RGB, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, Hue, Saturation and Value channels of the image using curves. Palettize\tLimits the number of colors of the image to the colors of the currently active palette. Each color is being mapped to the nearest color in the palette. Posterize\tLimits the number of colors of the image to the posterization level. Can also set an optional dither intensity. Gradient map\tConverts the colors of the image into a gradient, based on their lightness. Darker colors are mapped to colors on the left side of the gradient, and brighter colors are mapped to colors on the right side of the gradient. Outline\tGenerates an outline, with a given thickness, color and pattern. The outline is being generated outside the pixels that have transparent pixels are neighbors. If &quot;place inside image&quot; is toggled on, the outline is being drawn on these pixels themselves, rather than outside them. Drop shadow\tCreates a shadow of the image's content at a given offset, with a given color. Gradient\tGenerates a gradient. Its colors can be modified from the gradient edit, by clicking on the colored area to add new color steps. Clicking on the color steps with the left mouse allows you to change the color of that step, and right clicking on a step, removes it. Gradients can either be linear or radial, and they can optionally be dithered and/or repeated. You can also generate step gradients by changing the interpolation type to constant.

You can make a shader yourself either by coding it yourself in the Godot Shading Language, or by using Godot's editor to make a Visual Shader. Alternatively, you can find ready to use shaders made by other people online. One of the best places to look for Godot shaders is https://godotshaders.com/shader-type/canvas_item/.  To load a shader, you can drag and drop the shader file from your file editor into Pixelorama. The file extension of code shaders is .gdshader, and of visual shaders is .tres. Then, you can find the effect under the Effects menu, under the &quot;Loaded&quot; subcategory. If you want to use it as a layer effect you can find it by pressing the &quot;FX&quot; button in the layer area of the timeline, then click on &quot;Add Effect&quot; in the dialog that appeared, and find your effect under the &quot;Loaded&quot; subcategory.  If your shader is using the TIME variable, it will not work well when loaded in Pixelorama. Instead, you can add a uniform named PXO_time (by adding uniform float PXO_time; as a line in the uniform area of your shader code), and replace all instances of TIME with PXO_time. PXO_time is a special uniform that measures the time in seconds passed every time a frame plays. For example, if your project runs at 5 frames per second, PXO_time will be equal to 0.2 (1 frame divided by 5 FPS is equal to 0.2 seconds, which is the time it takes for a single frame to play) when the second frame plays, if it has no custom delay. On the third frame it would be equal to 0.4, and so on. On the first frame, PXO_time is always equal to 0. PXO_time is also affected by the individual delay of each frame. By default, frames have no individual delay.  If you want to access the current frame index in your shader, you can use a uniform integer named PXO_frame_index. Similarly, you can use a uniform named PXO_layer_index to access the current layer index.  In the future, we plan to create a custom effect graph which will let users create effects directly within Pixelorama itself, and it will look and function similarly to Godot's Visual Shader editor.

The two mouse buttons can be used independently of one another. In the toolbar, you will see one of the tool buttons having a half background on the left side of the button as blue.

There are three loop modes:  Cycle loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it will start playing again from the first frame. This is the default option.Ping-pong. When the animation reaches the final frame, it begins playing backward, starting from that final frame. When it reaches the first frame, it will again start playing forward until it reaches the final frame, and so on.No loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it simply stops playing.

Onion skinning is useful for animations because it's a simple and easy way to preview the previous and next frames at the same time as the frame you are currently editing. For more details, you can read this Wikipedia article.  The button on the right simply toggles onion skinning on and off, and the one on the left brings up options, like the amount of past (previous) and future (next) frames that appear, and blue-red mode, which tints the previous frames blue, and the next frames red.  ignore onion skinning If you want a layer to ignore onion skinning, you can right click on the layer button in the timeline, select &quot;Properties&quot; and enable the &quot;Ignore in onion skinning&quot; option.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Layers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"The Timeline","url":"/user_manual/user_interface/timeline#layers","content":" On the left side of the timeline, you will see the layer buttons. Clicking on a layer button will select the current layer. Double-clicking will let you change the name of that layer. Right clicking a layer button will open up a menu, with options such as the layer's properties, and whether it's a clipping mask or not.  The layer buttons have three more buttons on them. The first toggles the layer's visibility. While invisible, the layer cannot be edited by the user. It will also remain invisible on export. The second locks and unlocks the layer. If the layer is locked, it cannot be edited by the user, but it does remain visible. The third button is used to automatically link the new cels that are being created. If it's toggled on, it is essentially a fast way to create linked cels.  There are 7 more buttons located on top of the layers. These, in order of appearance: add a new layer, remove the currently active layer, move the current layer up and down, clone the current layer, merge the current layer with the one directly below it, and open up a dialog for layer effects. Below these buttons, you can change the selected layer's blend mode and opacity.

These are the frame buttons, and the number they have is their order in the animation.  Clicking on a frame button will select that frame, and right-clicking a frame button will open up a menu. The menu options include frame properties, remove frame, clone frame, move frame to the left, move frame to the right, new tag, reverse frames (only works when multiple frames are selected), and center frames. Clicking on frame properties brings up a window that lets you change the duration of that frame, as well as set custom user-defined data.  frame duration By default, the duration of each frame is set to 1x, which means it will take exactly as much time as the timeline FPS (frames per second). Setting it to 2x, for example, that frame will take twice as much time, while setting it to 0.5x will take half the time, meaning it will play out faster.  You can also drag and drop frame buttons to re-arrange them. This will also affect their corresponding cels.  On the top side of the timeline, you will find frame-related buttons which offer the same functionality as the frame button right-click menu, like adding, removing, cloning and moving frames.

Those parts can also be exported independently using frame tags.  To create a new tag, you can right click on a frame button and select &quot;New Tag&quot;. A popup will appear that lets you set a name for the tag, a color, the starting (from) and ending (to) frame, as well as custom user-defined data.  To edit an already existing tag, you can click on its name on the timeline, above the frame area. You can quickly move and resize it by dragging its edges.  If &quot;Animation plays only on frames of the same tag&quot; is toggled on in the timeline options, then, when you preview your animation, it will only preview the frames that belong on the same tag as the currently selected frame. This is a great way to preview parts of your animation separately.

For a more detailed explanation, you can read this page. To select a cel in order to draw on it, you can left-click on their respective button. The cel buttons take the most space in the timeline, and they are located to the right of the layer buttons and below the frame buttons. They also have a small preview of their image data on them.  Right-clicking on a cel button will bring up a menu, with options such as properties, link (or unlink) cel, and delete, which clears the content of the cel, making it fully transparent. In the cel properties, you can change their opacity (cel opacity is different than layer opacity), their z-index and also set custom user-defined data.  Selecting multiple cels You can select/deselect multiple cels by holding the Control key and left-clicking individual cels, or hold the Shift key and left-click a cel to also select all of the cels between the one that was clicked and the one that has been selected last. This also works on frame and layer buttons. For example, selecting two frame buttons using Control or Shift will select all of their cels as well. The same is true for layer buttons.  Drag and drop You can drag and drop layer, frame and cel buttons to re-arrange them. Re-arranging frame and layer buttons also affects their cels.
