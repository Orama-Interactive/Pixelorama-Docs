Welcome fellow dreamer to the documentation of Pixelorama, your free and open source pixel-art creation tool, developed by Orama Interactive and our contributors. If you are new to this documentation, we recommend you start by reading the [User Interface Basics](user_manual/user_interface/user_interface_basics) page to familiarize yourself with Pixelorama's workspace. The ultimate goal of this program is to be able to catch up with the user's imagination and assist them in creating any kind of pixel art they wish. This could be a cool landscape, a dope animation, game graphics, random sketches or a well thought pixelated meme. Thank you for coming this far into researching our tool!

Here you will understand the tool better, learn of every aspect and feature it has, follow its tutorials and eventually you will be able to master it and apply it to your own pixelated goals. If you are an experienced pixel artist, familiar with most of Pixelorama's functionalities you can search some specific features and understand them better or get some ideas on how to creatively apply techniques you may not have thought of. In any case fasten your seat belts because we are about to start!

## Before we start:
If you encounter any issue regarding the documentation, the program isn't working properly or something isn't as clarified and you have a question regarding it, you can seek help in our community channels.
