i didn't know where to place [animating_effects.md](animating_effects), and i suspect that in future we'll have more miscellaneous features like this which we'll find difficult in categorizing

for example another one such feature will come when 1.x gets released called "paste tags across projects", (in 0.11.x this only works within project and not globally so was enough to just mention it in timeline.md) but not when 1.x comes as it's become more complex and we'll have to make a separate page so as not to bloat timeline.md.
