Palettes are a way to organise colors in your projects.

Pixelorama ships on most platforms with several pre-made palettes. These palettes can be freely modified.

All palettes are physically stored on disk in Pixelorama data folder.

:::danger undo/redo
Palettes currently don't support undo/redo so be careful with any modifications because they are permanent.

## Palettes panel

Top of the panel consists of `Palettes selector`, [`Edit palette button`](#editing-palette-metadata) and [`Add new palette button`](#creating-new-palette).

The main section is the [`Palette grid`](#palette-grid) displaying all colors present in the currently selected palette.

In the left of the [`Palette grid`](#palette-grid) are [`tools`](#palette-grid-tools) used to edit colors of the palette.
