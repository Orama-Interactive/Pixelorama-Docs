title: Compiling from Source
---

To compile Pixelorama's source code, all you have to do is download [Godot 4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/). You don't need the mono version since Pixelorama is written entirely with GDScript. Then, you clone [Pixelorama from its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), load the project within Godot, and run it! Simple as that!

If you wish to export Pixelorama as a standalone executable to a platform, you can refer to the relevant page of the documentation of Godot: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html
