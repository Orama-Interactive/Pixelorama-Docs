title: Compiling from Source

To compile Pixelorama's source code, all you have to do is download [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download/). You don't need the mono version since Pixelorama is written entirely with GDScript. Then, you clone [Pixelorama from its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), load the project within Godot, and run it! Simple as that!
