## Contributing Code
You are free to open pull-requests to [Pixelorama's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) to fix issues or implement new features. Keep in mind, however, that not all PRs will be merged. Some may need discussion, or others may be downright closed. Make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first.

## Contributing Feedback
Did you find a bug? Do you have a super cool idea for the development of Pixelorama and want to share it? Then the best way to do it is by opening a [Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/categories/ideas). That is the most effective way for your feedback to be seen and discussed with the team and other developers that are interested in helping.
