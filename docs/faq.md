If you have any questions about Pixelorama, there is a chance that someone else had the same question before, so it will be answered here, in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). The question is indicated with "Q" and the answer with "A".

## Q: How much does Pixelorama cost?
A: Pixelorama is available for the *extremely cheap price of $0.00!* That's right! Pixelorama is a [free and open-source software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), available under the (very permissive) [MIT license](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/LICENSE)! In short:
- You are free to download and use Pixelorama for any purpose, personal, non-profit, commercial, or otherwise.
- You are free to modify, distribute, redistribute, and remix Pixelorama to your heart’s content, for any reason, both non-commercially and commercially.

## Q: What platforms is Pixelorama available on?
A: Pixelorama is currently available for Windows, Linux, Mac and Web browsers. More platforms may be supported in the future.
You can download Pixelorama from [itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/releases). It is also available on Scoop for Windows, as a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.orama_interactive.Pixelorama) and [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/pixelorama) for Linux and in the [Open Store](https://open-store.io/app/pixelorama.orama-interactive) for Ubuntu Touch.

## Q: Who is working on Pixelorama?
A: Pixelorama is being developed by [Orama Interactive](https://www.orama-interactive.com/), a game development team. Of course, Pixelorama would not be the same without the help of our beloved [contributors](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/graphs/contributors)!

## Q: Is Pixelorama safe?
A: Pixelorama is completely safe, as long as you download it from official sources (see `Q: What platforms is Pixelorama available on?` above). Its open-source nature allows for perfect transparency, thus it is impossible for us to sneak in malicious code without anyone noticing. The official builds are also being generated directly from the source code using GitHub Actions, so there is no worry that someone is sneaking in malicious code in the process of compiling. You may, however, get some security warnings from security software, such as Windows SmartScreen. The reason for this is that Pixelorama is not signed, and thus not recognized by the security system. You can safely ignore these warnings and proceed to run Pixelorama.

## Q: What engine is being used to develop Pixelorama? Where is the code hosted?
A: Pixelorama is being developed with the Godot Engine (version 3.5), and since it is open-source anyone can contribute to it! The code is available on [Pixelorama's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama)!

## Q: Can I contribute to this project?
Yes! Read our [Ways to Contribute](development_and_contributing) page to learn more.

## Q: Will Pixelorama ever become Godot's Plugin?
A: Pixelorama was originally created as a stand-alone program. Our current focus is to keep improving it and not implementing it into Godot itself, but we are not declining the possibility of it being a plugin one day. However, if you are interested in direct Pixelorama support from Godot, you can use this amazing [Godot Pixelorama importer plugin](https://github.com/Technohacker/godot_pixelorama_importer) which can be used to make Godot import pxo files.

## Q: What languages is Pixelorama available in?
A: The main language is English, but Pixelorama is also available in numerous other languages! [All of our translation files are hosted in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/pixelorama). By default, the language that Pixelorama is in is the system language of your device. You can easily change it by going to the Edit menu, Preferences, Language.

## Q: What are the minimum system requirements to run Pixelorama?
A: Pixelorama is a relatively lightweight software and it should run on most devices, as long as OpenGL 2.1 / OpenGL ES 2.0 is supported.
