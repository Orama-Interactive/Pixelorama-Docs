Treat for sure, as we bring you a new version of Pixelorama as a Halloween present! Version 1.1.6 comes with various new features, such as diagonal symmetry, font loading, two new color picker shapes, and a lot more bug fixes and quality of life improvements!\\n\\nIf you wish to support us, you can [become a Patron](https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive) and receive exclusive awards, or [buy Pixelorama on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/), [or from itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n[![Become a patron](/img/blog/become_a_patron.png)](https://patreon.com/OramaInteractive)\\n\\n## New website\\nWe have launched a new website at https://pixelorama.org! It contains a landing page which briefly explains Pixelorama\'s features and contains links to download, the documentation you already know, and a blog. Feel free to let us know what you think! Starting from this version, the blog posts will be posted on Pixelorama\'s website instead of Orama\'s.\\n\\n## Extension incompatibility\\nDue to version 1.1.6 updating to Godot 4.5.1, Pixelorama extensions exported with Godot versions prior to 4.5 will no longer work. This essentially means that you have to **re-download** the extensions you are using, if you are using any, from the extension explorer when they get updated, which they will shortly after this release. If you are an extension developer, simply re-export your extension using Godot 4.5 or 4.5.1 and it should work fine.\\n\\n## Full changelog of version 1.1.6:\\n\\n### Added\\n- Added buttons that enable diagonal symmetry!\\n- If Pixelorama crashed in the previous session, a window will appear the next time it is launched to let the user know that they can restore data, if there are any projects that can be restored.\\n- Two new color picker shapes, OK HS Rectangle and OK HL Rectangle.\\n- Users can now drag and drop font files to load them. Fonts can be used by the text tool, text meshes in 3D layers and the user interface itself.\\n- Added an Undo History dialog.\\n- The convolution matrix layer effect now has a kernel normalization factor.\\n- Added Arabic translation and made improvements to the UI so that it works better for Right-To-Left languages.\\n- Pixelorama can now load Lospec palettes if started with \\"lospec-palette://\\" plus the palette\'s name as a CLI argument. In theory, this allows Pixelorama to open when clicking on the \\"Open In App\\" button on a palette on Lospec\'s website, but for now **it does not work automatically**, as it requires different setup for different operating systems.\\n- A preview.png file is now saved inside pxo files. This can help file managers to generate thumbnails for pxo files. **Note that this doesn\'t mean that you will automatically see thumbnails for pxo files \u2014 it\'s up to file managers to implement this.**\\n\\n### Changed\\n- **Extensions made for previous versions of Pixelorama will fail to load on this version.** Make sure to re-download the extensions you want.\\n- The timeline now scrolls when adding/moving layers, when the current cel is changing from shortcuts or from the timeline buttons, and when cels, frames and layers are being dragged.\\n- The layer effect settings dialog now scrolls automatically when dragging layer effects to re-order them.\\n- When moving frames using the arrow buttons in the timeline, all moved cels are now being selected. [#1358](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1358)\\n- The \\"Offset/Zoom\\" effect has been renamed to \\"Offset & Scale\\". [#1362](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1362)\\n- On Linux, the native screen color picker of the operating system is now used.\\n- The canvas can now be moved by arrow keys if there is a selection tool selected, but there is not an active selection. If there is, the selection itself gets moved, just like before.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- The canvas no longer jitters when it is zoomed out a lot and smooth zoom is enabled.\\n- The screen color picker now works properly on Linux, users can pick colors outside of Pixelorama\'s window.\\n- Optimized the \\"Mirror Image\\" effect when a selection is active. Now it should no longer lag on big canvases.\\n- Fixed a crash when a user selects a 3D object, then does an undo or redo [#1353](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1353)\\n- Fixed tilemap cells being erased in manual mode if there are cells outside of the canvas boundaries.\\n- Invisible layers are no longer included when exporting images in headless mode, such as from the command line. [#1368](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1368)\\n- Fixed transparent checkers not following canvas movement vertically, if \\"Follow canvas movement\\" was enabled, and \\"Follow canvas zoom level\\" was disabled from the Preferences.\\n- The color picker\'s RGB values can no longer go higher than 255. [#349](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/349)\\n- Fixed the restore to default button in the Preferences not hiding after being clicked next to text fields and color buttons.\\n- Fixed the \\"Open last project\\" button in the splash screen not hiding in the Web version.\\n\\nHappy painting, and keep pixelating your dreams! \ud83c\udfa8\u2728\\n\\nPixelorama is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/) and [Itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)!"},{"id":"pixelorama-1.1.5-is-out","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.1.5-is-out","source":"@site/blog/pixelorama-1.1.5-is-out.md","title":"Pixelorama v1.1.5 is out!","description":"Artwork by Roroto Sic, made with Pixelorama","date":"2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanouil Papadeas","title":"Lead developer of Pixelorama","url":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama","mastodon":"https://mastodon.social/@Overloaded@mastodon.social","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/overloadedorama.bsky.social","twitch":"https://twitch.tv/OverloadedLIVE","x":"https://x.com/OVLDD"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama.png","key":"Overloaded","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.1.5 is out!","slug":"pixelorama-1.1.5-is-out","date":"2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/img/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out/main.png","authors":["Overloaded"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.1.6 is out!","permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.1.6-is-out"},"nextItem":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.1.3 is out!","permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.1.3-is-out"}},"content":"![Artwork by Roroto Sic, made with Pixelorama](/img/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out/main.png)\\nArtwork by [Roroto Sic](https://linktr.ee/Roroto_Sic), one of the artists for v1.1\'s splash screen artworks.\\n\\nAnother maintenance release, Pixelorama v1.1.5 arrives today!

This is consistent with how frames get deleted, and is what users would expect.\\n- During animation playback on frames of a tag, if the user changes to a frame of a different tag, then the frames of that tag are being played. [#1311](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1311)\\n- Using the move tool on a tilemap layer while draw tiles mode is active now clears the selection, if there is any.

The way it currently works is that before we release a new major version, such as 1.0 and 1.1, we announce a time period (usually around a month) where everyone can draw an artwork made with Pixelorama, and they can submit it to the `#pixelorama-splash-screen` channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GTMtr8s). This causes problems where some artists may be unavailable to work on an artwork at that time, and it also causes problems for us because the event creates an extra delay to major releases, as it is an important factor we have to take into account before a new major version.\\n\\nGoing forward, we are going to get rid of the time limit and allow everyone to submit artworks for the next major version **whenever they want**. This essentially means that you can submit an artwork for the next major version, which will be 1.2, **right now**. This is true for every major release from now on. The moment a new major version is out, we will start accepting entries for the next major version.\\n\\nWe do not have a release date for v1.2, so you will have to wait for a while before seeing it in Pixelorama. However, we believe that this new system will be beneficial for everyone, as it is more asynchronous. If you prefer the old system, you have nothing to worry about, as we will still put out an announcement before releasing a new major version to remind you to participate in the event.\\n\\nIf you are interested, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GTMtr8s), where the event takes place. We have added a new role for people who are interested in receiving updates for the event, so make sure to grab it from \\"Channels & Roles\\". We hope to see a lot more entries for v1.2, and we can\'t wait to see what you create!\\n\\n## Full changelog of version 1.1.1:\\n\\n### Added\\n- Implemented isometric & hexagonal tile shapes for tilemap layers! [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Implemented a hexagonal grid type, with support for both pointy-top and flat-top orientations.\\n- It is now possible to flatten all selected layers into one layer.\\n- Hexagonal pointy-top and flat-top presets have been added in the tile mode offsets dialog.\\n- Added a single bezier mode in curve tool, that works similarly to Aseprite\'s curve tool. [#1216](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1216)\\n- OpenRaster (`.ora`) and Aseprite (`.ase`/`.aseprite`) files are now being displayed as options in the \\"Open\\" dialog.\\n- Added shortcuts for going to the previous/next frame of the same tag. By default, they are mapped to <kbd>Control + < </kbd> and <kbd>Control + ></kbd> respectively.\\n- Holding the \\"automatically change layer\\" shortcut (<kbd>Control + Alt</kbd> by default) now displays a rectangle around the selected cel, or around the cel whose non-transparent pixels are being hovered by the cursor.\\n- Users can now color code their cels in the timeline.\\n- A button for reporting extensions has been added to the extension explorer. [#1214](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1214)\\n\\n### Changed\\n- Resizing the canvas, cropping to content and centering frames now moves the offset of each tilemap layer instead of affecting its tileset. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Scaling the project also scales the size of the tiles by the same amount that the project was scaled. For example, scaling a 64x64 project to 128x64 would scale 16x16 tiles to 32x16. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Switched \\"tags by column\\" and \\"tags by rows\\" in the export dialog, when exporting spritesheets.\\n- The minimum window size has been decreased to (300, 200). [#1221](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/1221)\\n- The pencil/eraser/shading brush flip/rotation UI is now consistent with the tiles panel flip/rotation UI, and it also supports the same shortcuts.\\n- The shortcut groups in the Preferences have been re-organized. The Buttons group has been removed, instead the shortcuts are grouped according to their respective panels, such as Timeline, Global Tool Options and Palettes.\\n- Cels with a non-zero z-index display a \\"z\\" in the timeline.\\n- The reference image rotation incerement step was changed to 0.01. [#1210](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/#1210)\\n- When opening the new tag dialog, the name field automatically grabs focus.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- Value sliders and rulers are no longer displaying integers as floats.\\n- Fixed a crash when using the lasso and polygon select tools outside of the canvas.\\n- Using the bucket tool on draw tiles mode on an empty tilemap no longer crashes the app. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Fixed a crash when switching between tilemap layers with different tilesets, while having selected tiles the positions of which do not exist on the new tilemap\'s tileset. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Duplicating tilesets in the project properties no longer crashes the app when a previously deleted tileset is still selected. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Fixed the import tag option not pasting the frame content, and not working for tilemap and audio layers.\\n- Z-indexed cels are now being rendered with their proper order in the canvas. [#1220](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1220)\\n- The \\"change layer automatically\\" shortcut (<kbd>Control + Alt</kbd> by default) no longer works when a selection tool is active, thus preventing the shortcut conflict with the \\"transform copy selected content\\" shortcut.\\n- Prevent switching project tabs and saving, if a native save file dialog is already open. This prevents rare cases of saving two open projects with the same name, thus leading to data loss.\\n- The native save file dialog now always has a default name for the saved .pxo file.\\n- Fixed horizontal scrolling on the timeline on macOS. [#1219](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1219)\\n- Fixed selection resizing not working from the tool options. [#1212](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1212)\\n- The tile indices that appear when holding <kbd>Control</kbd> and a tilemap layer is selected, now scale based on the grid cell size. [#1213](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1213)\\n- Applying layer effects to passthrough group layer immediately updates the canvas.\\n- The \\"select pixels\\" from the cel menu now works properly with undo.\\n- Fixed a \\"section not found\\" error in the Preferences when launching Pixelorama for the first time. [#1211](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/#1211)\\n- Fixed the pencil density slider value not updating when switching between tools.\\n- Fixed the color picker acting weirdly when the alpha of the color is set to 0.\\n- Rulers now update whenever the canvas panel resizes.\\n- Fixed a regression in v1.1 where mouse button shortcuts (such as the mouse thumb buttons) were not activating tools.\\n- Empty audio layers now only show the audio icon in the frame where the audio is supposed to start playing.\\n- Fixed issue where the wrong font would be chosen for the interface in certain circumstances. [#1217](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/#1217)\\n- Fixed canvas preview\'s camera not being fit to frame when Pixelorama first launches and the canvas preview is visible.\\n\\n### Removed\\n- The \\"All\\" grid type option has been removed, as it is no longer needed since we can now display multiple grids at once.\\n\\nHappy painting, and keep pixelating your dreams! \ud83c\udfa8\u2728\\n\\nPixelorama is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/) and [Itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)!"},{"id":"pixelorama-1.1-is-out","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out","source":"@site/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out.md","title":"Pixelorama v1.1 is out!","description":"Artwork by Roroto Sic, made with Pixelorama","date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":11.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanouil Papadeas","title":"Lead developer of Pixelorama","url":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama","mastodon":"https://mastodon.social/@Overloaded@mastodon.social","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/overloadedorama.bsky.social","twitch":"https://twitch.tv/OverloadedLIVE","x":"https://x.com/OVLDD"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/OverloadedOrama.png","key":"Overloaded","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.1 is out!","slug":"pixelorama-1.1-is-out","date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["Overloaded"],"image":"/img/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out/main.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.1.1 is out!","permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.1.1-is-out"},"nextItem":{"title":"Pixelorama v1.0.5 is out!","permalink":"/blog/pixelorama-1.0.5-is-out"}},"content":"![Artwork by Roroto Sic, made with Pixelorama](/img/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out/main.png)\\nArtwork by [Roroto Sic](https://linktr.ee/Roroto_Sic), one of the artists for v1.1\'s splash screen artworks.\\n\\nPixelorama v1.1 is here, bringing a lot of game-changing new features! \ud83c\udf89 This release introduces highly anticipated additions like tilemap layers, audio layers, indexed mode, a brand new text tool, and much more!\\n\\nThe journey to implement these features in such a short time has been challenging, but your incredible support has kept us going. We\'re thrilled to keep improving Pixelorama with the help of this amazing community.

Tilemap layers are a special type of pixel layer which use a tileset, and each cell of the grid has a reference to a tile from that tileset. Tilemaps are usually used when designing levels for games. Tilemap layers have a draw tiles mode which, when enabled, allows you to directly modify tiles on the canvas. You can read more information on [Pixelorama\'s documentation](https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama-Docs/user_manual/tilemaps).\\n\\n![A GIF of a tileset being resized with selection tools, using the draw tiles mode.](/img/blog/pixelorama-1.1-is-out/tileset_selection_resize.gif)\\n\\n## Indexed mode\\nIndexed mode is an alternative color mode to the default, which is RGBA. In indexed mode, each pixel is assigned to a number that references a palette color. This essentially means that the colors of the image are restricted to a specific palette, and they will automatically get updated when you make changes to that palette, or when you switch to a different one. More information [here](https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama-Docs/concepts/color_mode).\\n\\n## Text tool\\nAfter years of waiting, a text tool is finally here. Currently this is destructive, meaning that once you confirm the text, you cannot edit it later. In the future I would also like to add non-destructive editing, either when using the text tool on a vector layer (whenever they get implemented), or by making a new type of layer entirely for text.\\n\\n## Audio layers\\nIt\'s been awfully quiet here. Time to make some noise! Audio layers have been added, allowing artists to easily synchronize their animations with music and sound effects. Each audio layer contains an audio file, which can be played at any time during the animation. Users can load an audio file (only `.mp3` and `.wav` files are supported at the moment), and choose the frame they want the audio to start playing. Audio also gets [imported/exported with videos, if FFMPEG is installed](https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama-Docs/user_manual/save_and_export#export-a-video).\\n\\n## Custom effect loading\\nDo you like using effects, but find that the amount of effects Pixelorama offers is lacking? This is no longer a problem, as you can now load Godot 4 `canvas_item` shaders as custom effects. There are a few things to keep in mind, so make sure to read [the documentation](https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama-Docs/user_manual/image_effects#loading-custom-effects). In the future (maybe v1.2? \ud83d\udc40), we plan to create a custom effect graph which will let users create effects directly within Pixelorama itself, and it will look and function similarly to Godot\'s Visual Shader editor.\\n\\n## Pasting from clipboard\\nA \\"Paste from Clipboard\\" option has been added to the Edit menu, allowing images from the operating system\'s clipboard to be pasted into Pixelorama. Note that copying images from Pixelorama into the OS\' clipboard has not been implemented at the moment.\\n\\n## Full changelog of version 1.1:\\n\\n### Added\\n- Tilemap layers have arrived! Tilemap layers allow artists to create tiles, and easily preview and dynamically modify them within Pixelorama. [#1146](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1146)\\n- Indexed mode has finally been implemented! [#1136](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1136)\\n- Audio layers have been added, allowing artists to easily synchronize their animations with audio. [#1149](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1149)\\n- Added a new text tool. Destructive only for now, meaning that once the text is confirmed, it cannot be changed later. [#1134](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1134)\\n- A \\"Paste from Clipboard\\" option has been added to the Edit menu, allowing images from the operating system\'s clipboard to be pasted into Pixelorama. Note that copying images from Pixelorama into the OS\' clipboard has not been implemented at the moment.\\n- A color curves image and layer effect has been added.\\n- A gradient layer effect has been added, alongside its already existing image effect equivalent, allowing for non-destructive gradient generation.\\n- It is now possible to load custom Godot shaders as image and layer effects.\\n- Importing OpenRaster (`.ora`) and Aseprite (`.ase`/`.aseprite`) files is now possible. Exporting to these file formats is not yet supported.\\n- Loading custom dithering patterns as images is now possible. This is not exposed somewhere in the UI yet, users have to go to Pixelorama\'s data folder (the same place where its settings, backups etc are kept), and create a \\"dither_matrices\\" folder and add the images there.\\n- A new Reset layout option has been added to the Layouts submenu, that can be used to reset default layouts to their original state.\\n- Implemented support for multiple grids. [#1122](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1122)\\n- Overhauled the gradient edit widget\'s UI and added options such as reverse and evenly distribute points, and gradient presets.\\n- Users can now color code their layers in the timeline.\\n- A new \\"Select cel area\\" option has been added to the Selection menu that makes a rectangular selection around the content of the active cel, and it is mapped to <kbd>Control + T</kbd> by default.\\n- Added a \\"Select pixels\\" option in the right click popup menu button of cel buttons\\n- Added a shortcut to swap tools, <kbd>Shift + X</kbd> by default. [#1173](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1173)\\n- Added <kbd>V</kbd> as the default shortcut for the crop tool.\\n- A \\"Show Reference Images\\" option has been added to the View menu, allowing quick and easy reference image toggling.\\n- Hiding the notification labels is now possible from the Preferences.\\n- StartupWMClass has been added to Pixelorama\'s Linux .desktop file. [#1170](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1170)\\n\\n### Changed\\n- The Manage Layouts dialog has been replaced by new items in the Layouts submenu, that are responsible for adding and deleting layouts.\\n- The default shortcuts of the Move tool and the Pan tool have been changed to <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd> respectively.\\n- The \\"Image\\" menu has been renamed to \\"Project\\". This name should be more accurate, since this menu has options that affect the entire project.\\n- Simplified the change layer automatically shortcut to just <kbd>Control + Alt</kbd>.\\n- The image and layer effects have been organized into subcategories.\\n- Layer buttons in the timeline now have a small icon on their right side that denotes their type, such as pixel layers, group layers, 3D layers, tilemap layers and audio layers.\\n- Layer buttons in the timeline also have an icon if the layers contain at least one layer effect.\\n- The import dialog is always being opened when opening images from File > Open.\\n- The extension crash preventing system has been revised. [#1177](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1177)\\n- The minimum cel size is now smaller, and it can get even smaller by decreasing the font size from the Preferences.\\n- System font names are now sorted by alphabetical order.\\n- The red, green, blue and alpha buttons in invert and desaturate layer effects have been made into \\"RGBA\\" buttons instead of checkboxes, just like they are in their image effect counterparts.\\n- \\"Tile Mode\\" under the Selection menu has been renamed to \\"Wrap Strokes\\". This does not affect the \\"Tile Mode\\" option in the View menu. [#1150](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1150)\\n- Improved the look of 3D object gizmos. [#1194](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1194)\\n- Re-organized the licenses in the About dialog. There are now three license categories, the Pixelorama license, the Godot licenses and the third-party licenses.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- The text is no longer blurry and hard to read of menus and dialog windows, if the display scale is set to anything but 100%. This was fixed due to the update to Godot 4.4. [#1065](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1065)\\n- Saving pxo files should no longer freeze the application on GNOME, when using native file dialogs. This was fixed due to the update to Godot 4.4. [#1115](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1115)\\n- Fixed crash when Pixelorama starts without a palette.\\n- Undo/redo now works again when the cursor is hovering over the timeline.\\n- The first frame is no longer exported twice when using ping-pong loop.\\n- Fixed pencil/eraser/shading previews turning white for a brief moment when changing image brushes, and when switching between tools.\\n- Fixed the preview on the left tool not being visible, if the right tool had a preview. [#1157](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1157)\\n- Dialogs that are children of other dialogs now always appear on top, to avoid issues where they could hide behind their parents and causing confusion that made Pixelorama seem unresponsive.\\n- Palette swatches now get deleted when the user removes all palettes.\\n- The CLI\'s output option now works with filepaths instead of just filenames. [#1145](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1145)\\n- Fixed a crash when importing a model in a 3D layer. [952498a](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/952498a2b8a72f0c7cdca87e763fc18ea12d8b5f)\\n- Loading obj files as custom models in 3D layers that are not paired with .mtl files now works. [#1165](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1165)\\n- Fixed a UI bug where the minimum size of the panels was not calculated correctly. [a28b526](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/a28b526645d2cc085b0d3eca9d0756aee8a6f978)\\n- Dockable panels are now properly sorted when toggling movable panels. [d7ba7fe](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/d7ba7fe6fc4f2efb587234634020bf567474dba9)\\n- Changing the name of pxo files when saving them in the Web version now works as intended. [faae464](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/faae4648f0751b72cff0ff174c74cac2c499b994)\\n- Pixelorama\'s window no longer spawns at the position of a monitor that has been disconnected. [#1189](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1189)\\n- Fixed the resize canvas dialog\'s offset not resetting to zero on dialog popup. [f273918](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/f273918368f568f860a8d08d28f5c9d9346461a4)\\n- Fixed group layer blending when they contain invisible layers. [#1166](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1166)\\n- Fixed color picker changing hue when modifying the saturation and value inside the color picker shape. [3f2245c](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/3f2245cd9bc81b1a244ae394927aa074650a5d70)\\n- Fixed the Palettize effect and palette exporting to images storing slightly wrong color values. [77f6bcf](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/77f6bcf07bd80bc042e478bb883d05900cebe436)\\n- Fixed some issues with the Palettize effect where the output would be different if the palette size changed and empty swatches were added, even if the colors themselves stayed the same. Initially fixed by [bd7d3b1](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/bd7d3b19cc98804e9b99754153c4d553d2048ee3), but [1dcb696](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/1dcb696c35121f8208bde699f87bb75deff99d13) is the proper fix.\\n- The lasso and polygon select tools now select all expected pixels without gaps, when the selection goes out of the canvas bounds.\\n- Fixed bug where the child windows of floating windows appear behind them.\\n- Fixed layouts overwriting the position info of panels, which were added by extensions. [#1172](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1172)\\n- Image export with split layers no longer ignores layer effects. [#1193](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1193)\\n- Fixed recorder label not updating when project is changed. [#1139](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1139)\\n- The vertical scrollbar in the timeline is no longer visible when it\'s not needed.\\n- Fixed a bug where the mouse cursor does not reset to default when hovering over a selection gizmo, and the selection gets cleared. [ead7593](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/ead7593e7e4013238b9e935ee24d8cea0ad49b38)\\n- Fixed a curve tool preview bug where the preview was changing when the cursor was moving, but the end point was staying the same. [d0fef33](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/d0fef332315a856d3ef0384eddee89c6c61eb6e0)\\n\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\nWhen v1.0 was released, I wrote some plans I had for the future of Pixelorama. I am happy to say that a lot of the stuff from that list have now been implemented, such as the indexed mode, tilemap layers, custom shader loading, shading tool mode that works directly with palette colors, color curves, brightness/contrast adjusting, gradient saving and custom dithering pattern support. All that (and so many more!) in the span of just 8 months! But, of course, there is still so much more to be done, and we will keep needing your support in order to implement these new features. These are my current plans, in no particular order:\\n\\n- An effect graph which will let users create effects directly within Pixelorama itself.\\n- An Android version.\\n- Vector layers, for non-destructive shape editing and text editing.\\n- The ability to rotate and skew selections directly with gizmos.\\n- Autotiling for tilemap layers.\\n- Even more tools, such as a gradient tool.\\n- Support for skeletal, bone-based 2D animation system.\\n- A more powerful brush system, perhaps giving the ability for users to create their own code-based brushes instead of just images.\\n- Better compatibility with other software, such as exporting directly to Godot nodes and resources in the form on AnimationPlayer, AnimatedSprite, TileSet and TileMapLayer, etc.\\n- More love for the 3D layers, such as the ability to edit an object\'s material, and load and export GLTF files.\\n- Performance improvements, especially for operations that affect a large number of pixels. Some of the algorithms we use may have to be re-written in C++.\\n\\nThank you so much for reading and for your continued support of Pixelorama!

[#1070](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1070)\\n- Added confirm and cancel buttons in the selection tool options to confirm/cancel an active transformation.\\n- OKHSL Lightness sorting in palettes has been implemented. [#1126](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1126)\\n\\n### Changed\\n- The brush size no longer changes by <kbd>Control</kbd> + Mouse Wheel when resizing the timeline cels or the palette swatches.\\n- Improved the UI of the Tile Mode Offsets dialog and added an \\"Isometric\\" preset button.\\n- The Recorder panel now automatically records for the current project. This also allows for multiple projects to be recorded at the same time.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- Opening the Tile Mode Offsets dialog no longer crashes the application.\\n- Panels no longer get scrolled when using the mouse wheel over a slider.\\n- Fixed layer effect slider values being rounded to the nearest integer.\\n- Fixed memory leak where the project remained referenced by a drawing tool, even when its tab was closed.\\n- Fixed memory leak where the first project remained forever references in memory by the Recorder panel.\\n- Slightly optimize circle brushes by only calling the ellipse algorithms once while drawing\\n\\n### Removed\\n- The Recorder panel has been removed from the Web version. It wasn\'t functional anyway in a way that was useful, and it\'s unsure if we can find a way to make it work.\\n\\nThank you all for taking the time to read this blog post and for supporting us.

A new Pixelorama update arrives today, and with quite a lot of goodies this time!\\n\\nProbably the biggest new feature of them all is the ability to make panels into floating windows! To use this feature, you first have to enable \\"Moveable panels\\" from the Window menu, tabs will appear on top of every panel. On the right side of these tabs, you will have a menu with a single option - \\"Make floating\\". Click on that and the panel will become its own window. Close the window to turn it back into a panel. If you have \\"single window mode\\" disabled from the preferences, the windows will also be able to be placed outside of Pixelorama\'s main window, which can be pretty useful for multi-monitor setups!\\n\\n<video controls style={{ maxWidth: \\"100%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}>\\n    <source src={floating_windows} type=\\"video/mp4\\">\\n    </source>\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\nA short video showcasing the aforementioned feature.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAnother important new feature is the new \u201cColor replace\u201d mode of the Shading tool. This mode allows you to choose colors from a palette as lights or shadows, similar to how Aseprite\'s shading ink works, in contrast to the other two modes that generate new colors. This is useful if you want to limit your sprite\u2019s colors to a specific palette.\\n\\nAs always, if you wish to support us, you can [become a Patron](https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive) and receive exclusive awards, or [buy Pixelorama on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/), [or from itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)!\\n\\n[![Become a patron](/img/blog/become_a_patron.png)](https://patreon.com/OramaInteractive)\\n\\nFull changelog of version 1.0.4:\\n\\n### Added\\n- It is now possible to make panels into floating windows. This allows for any panel in the user interface to be its own window, and if single window mode is disabled, you can move these windows anywhere you want. This is especially useful for multi-monitor setups.\\n- Added a new \\"color replace\\" mode to the Shading tool, that uses the colors of the palette to apply shading. [#1107](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1107)\\n- Added a new Erase blend mode. [#1117](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1117)\\n- It is now possible to change the font, depth and line spacing of 3D text.\\n- Implemented the ability to change the font of the interface from the preferences.\\n- Clipping to selection during export is now possible.

[#1123](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1123)\\n- Added hotkeys to switch between tabs. <kbd>Control+Tab</kbd> to go to the next project tab, and <kbd>Control+Shift+Tab</kbd> to go to the previous. [#1109](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1109)\\n- Added menus next to each of the two mirroring buttons in the Global Tool Options, that allow users to automatically move the symmetry guides to the center of the canvas, or the view center.\\n- A new Reset category has been added to the Preferences that lets users easily restore certain options.\\n\\n### Changed\\n- Bumped extensions API version to 5.\\n- The screen no longer remains on when idle, avoiding unnecessary power consumption. [#1125](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1125)\\n- The export dialog\'s resize slider now allows for values greater than 1000.\\n- Made some UI improvements to the rotate/flip image brush options. [#1105](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1105)\\n- The bucket tool now picks colors from the top-most layer, like the rest of the drawing tools.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- The move tool preview is now properly aligned to the pixel grid.\\n- Camera zoom is now being preserved when switching between projects.\\n- Projects are no longer being saved with the wrong name in the Web version.\\n- Fixed 3D Shape Edit tool option values not updating when switching between 3D objects.\\n- Using the bucket tool while moving the cursor and also holding the color picker shortcut (Alt by default), now picks colors instead of actually using the tool.\\n- Tool previews are now being properly cleared when switching to other tools before finishing the action being performed by the previous tool.\\n- Fixed icons not being set to the correct color when launching Pixelorama with the dark theme.\\n- Fixed some text in the About dialog not having the text color of the theme.\\n- Fixed the backup confirmation dialog closing when clicking outside of it when single window mode is disabled.\\n- The dynamics dialog is now set to its correct size when something is made visible or invisible. [#1104](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1104)\\n- The color picker values no longer change when using RAW mode.

Just like the previous minor versions, this one also contains important bug fixes, but it comes with a few new features and improvements as well!\\n\\nAmong the new features is a new layer effect called Index Map, contributed by [Variable](https://github.com/Variable-ind). This effect makes the original red and green color values of the image act as x and y positions of a separate image (the map), and the result uses colors from the map based on the red and green color values from the source images. This allows you to change the colors of the map, and the changes get automatically applied to the source project. This can allow you to use techniques such as this:\\n<LiteYouTubeEmbed\\n  id=\\"HsOKwUwL1bE\\"\\n  params=\\"autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0\\"\\n  title=\\"Pixel Art Animation.

[#1085](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1085)\\n- Added a new Gaussian blur image and layer effect.\\n- A new Index Map layer effect has been added. [#1093](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1093)\\n- Is it now possible to adjust the opacity of onion skinning. [#1091](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1091)\\n- Added option to trim the empty area of the exported images. [#1088](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1088)\\n- A quality slider has been added to the export dialog, when exporting jpg files.\\n\\n### Changed\\n- The layer opacity and frame buttons are now fixed on top, always visible regardless of the vertical scroll position. [#1095](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1095)\\n- The default blend mode of layer groups is now pass-through.\\n- The color picker popup when editing gradients is now moveable.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- Fixed an issue where the \'\\\\n` escape character got inserted inside the palette name, causing the palette to fail to be saved.\\n- The export dialog has been optimized by caching all of the blended frames. Changing export options, besides the layers, no longer cause slowness by re-blending all of the frames.\\n- Optimized the lasso and polygon select tools, as well as the fill options of the pencil and curve tools. The time they take to complete now depends on the size of the selection, rather than checking all of the pixels of the entire canvas.\\n- Fixed a crash when re-arranging palette swatches while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>.\\n- Fixed a crash when using the move tool snapped to the grid.\\n- Fixed wrong preview in the gradient dialog when editing the gradient and dithering is enabled.\\n- Fixed a visual bug with the preview of the resize canvas dialog.\\n- Fixed wrong stretch mode in the cel button previews.

Layers that belong to the same group are now being blended together into a single texture, which represents the entire group. Layers outside the group are not affecting the group\'s blended texture. This has several advantages:\\n\\n- Group layers can have their own blend modes. A new \\"passthrough\\" mode has also been added that does not blend the children of the group together, as if the group doesn\'t exist.\\n- Group layers can both act as a clipping mask and be used by a clipping mask.\\n- Group layers and cels now have their own opacity.\\n- Group layer effects are no longer being applied recursively to each of its children, but instead they are being applied once in the final blended texture. This allows us to use some modern non-destructive techniques, such as HD Index Painting with dithering support, as seen in the video below.\\n\\n<video controls style={{ maxWidth: \\"100%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}>\\n    <source src={hd_index_painting} type=\\"video/mp4\\">\\n    </source>\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nFull changelog of version 1.0.2:\\n### Added\\n- Group layer blending is now supported. To prevent a layer group from blending, you can set its blend mode to \\"Pass through\\". [#1077](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1077)\\n- Added <kbd>Control+Shift+Alt</kbd> as a shortcut that automatically selects a layer directly from the canvas when using tools.\\n- Added tolerance to the bucket tool\'s \\"similar area\\" mode and to the magic wand tool.\\n- It is now possible to move all selected cels between different frames, but they all have to be on the same layer.\\n- Added a convolution matrix layer effect, still work in progress.\\n- Native file dialogs now have a checkbox that lets you save blended images inside .pxo files.\\n- It is now possible to change the maximum undo steps from the Preferences.\\n- Cel properties of group and 3D cels can now be edited.\\n\\n### Changed\\n- Renamed the \\"similarity\\" slider of the select by color tool and the bucket tool\'s \\"similar colors\\" mode to \\"tolerance\\", and made it work the inverse way to make it consistent with other art software.\\n- It is now possible to change the blend modes of multiple selected layers from the timeline\'s option button.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- The Web version no longer requires SharedArrayBuffer, so compatibility with certain browsers should be better now.\\n- Scaling with cleanEdge and OmniScale is now working again. [#1074](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1074)\\n- Layer effects are now being applied when exporting single layers.\\n- Exporting group layers now takes blending modes and layer effects into account.\\n- Fixed crashes when attempting to export specific layers or tags that have been deleted.\\n- Fixed crashes when importing brushes and palettes.\\n- Fixed an issue with the bucket tool filling with the wrong color.\\n- Fixed an issue when merging two layers, where if the bottom layer had layer/cel transparency, the transparency would be applied in the content destructively.\\n- Fixed an issue where color sliders wouldn\'t be visible during startup, if the color options button was expanded.\\n- Fixed bug where some buttons on the interface were not affected by the custom icon color on startup.\\n- Fixed an issue when loading a project, selecting a project brush and then switching tools. [#1078](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1078)\\n- Fixed wrong rendering of the isometric grid.

[#1041](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1041)\\n- The previews of the elliptical selection and the shape tools are now being mirrored, if a mirroring mode is enabled. This makes them consistent with the rectangle, lasso, paint and polygon selection tools.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- The previews of the shape and selection tools no longer make Pixelorama to be so slow.\\n- The performance of the shape tool drawing has been improved.\\n- Fixed an issue where if you increased a palette\'s width but also decreased its height, some colors would be lost, and re-ordering colors immediately after resizing would result in even more data loss. [#684](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/684)\\n- Dialogs no longer close when Pixelorama\'s main window loses focus and regains it.\\n- When single window mode is disabled, popup dialogs are no longer unclickable.

Thank you everyone who has wishlisted and followed our Steam page!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/2779170/\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" width=\\"646\\" height=\\"190\\"></iframe>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAs always, if you wish to support us, you can [become a Patron](https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive) and receive exclusive awards, [buy Pixelorama on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/) or [itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)! We really rely on your financial support so we can focus on Pixelorama\'s development and make it sustainable.\\n\\n[![Become a patron](/img/blog/become_a_patron.png)](https://patreon.com/OramaInteractive)\\n\\nSo, what is new in this version? Here\'s an overview of the biggest changes.\\n\\n## Layer blend modes\\nMultiple layer blend modes was a basic feature missing from Pixelorama, but no more! The blend modes currently supported are: Normal, Darken, Multiply, Color burn, Linear burn, Lighten, Screen, Color dodge, Add, Overlay, Soft light, Hard light, Difference, Exclusion, Subtract, Divide, Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity. You can read about what each mode does in our [documentation](https://www.oramainteractive.com/Pixelorama-Docs/concepts/layer). In the future I would like to support group layer blending as well.\\n\\n## Non-destructive layer effects\\nThe image effects that are available in Pixelorama can now also be applied as non-destructive effects per layer. Non-destructive essentially means that the effects do not permanently alter the image, unless you want them to. In the future I also plan to allow users to load custom shaders (written in Godot\'s shading language) for custom effects, as well as support animated effects.\\n\\n<video controls style={{ maxWidth: \\"100%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}>\\n    <source src={layerEffects} type=\\"video/mp4\\">\\n    </source>\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\n## Curve tool\\nA new curve tool has finally been implemented, allowing you to easily create pixelated bezier curves. You can change its size, as well as enable filling the area inside it, allowing it to be used as a polygon tool as well.\\n\\n## Clipping masks\\nLayers can now be used as clipping masks. Clipping masks can be used to draw the content of the layer only on top of the non-transparent pixels of the layer directly below. In other words, the layer below the clipping mask is what controls the visibility of the content of the clipping mask. You can make a layer be a clipping mask by right-clicking the layer button in the timeline, and toggling \\"Clipping mask\\". In the future, I also want to support group layers to support clipping masks.\\n\\n## New color picker panel\\nThe old color picker buttons are now gone and have been replaced with a new color picker panel that is always visible. This results in less clicks, making the selecting color process faster. To select whether you want to pick colors for either the left or the right tool, simply click on either the left or the right button below the picker, and the colors that will be picked will work for that respective button. The new color picker also supports multiple color shapes, such as the HSV Rectangle (default), HSV Wheel, VHS Circle and OKHSL Circle. You can also now use the OKHSL color mode.\\n![Screenshot of Pixelorama\'s new color picker panel](/img/blog/pixelorama-1.0-is-out/color_picker.png)\\n\\nClicking on \\"Color options\\" will bring out sliders that allow for more accurate color selection.\\n\\n## Extension explorer\\nYou can now find extensions that are available online easily, inside Pixelorama itself. Just go to the Edit menu, Preferences, Extensions and click on \\"Explore Online\\". From there, you can effortlessly download extensions without leaving the application at all.\\n\\n## Timeline improvements\\nWhat\'s a good update without some much needed timeline improvements? It is now (finally!) possible to drag and drop multiple selected cels/layers/frames to re-arrange them, instead of dragging them one by one. The frame tags have also received some love, as they can now be created from the frame button\'s right click menu, and to edit them all you need to do is either click on their name in the timeline, or drag around their edges to move and resize them!\\n\\n## Video importing and exporting\\nIt is now possible to import and export video files. However, for that to work, you need to download [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and place its installation path inside Pixelorama\'s Preferences. If FFMPEG is available as a PATH environment variable, simply putting `ffmpeg` in the Preferences should work, at least on Linux devices. In the future I would also like to implement the ability to add audio inside projects, and videos could be exported with the audio you added.\\n\\n## **IMPORTANT** -  Incompatibilities with previous versions\\nPixelorama 1.0 introduced some breaking changes.\\n- `.pxo` files have a completely new file format now than they used to, they are now essentially `.zip` files in disguise. While `.pxo` files from previous versions (from v0.8 to v0.11.4) can be loaded in v1.0, the opposite is not true, `.pxo` files exported from v1.0 **CANNOT** be imported to older versions.\\n- Due to security concerns for `.tres` files, palettes made in older versions **CANNOT** be opened in version 1.0. Version 1.0 uses `.json` files for palettes instead. However, starting with version 0.11.4, you can export your palettes as image files, which can later be imported by version 1.0 as palettes.\\n- Extensions made for Pixelorama v1.0 will not work for previous versions, and extensions made for Pixelorama v0.x will also not work for v1.0. This is due to the fact that 0.x versions use Godot 3, while 1.0 uses Godot 4.\\n- For the same reason as above, custom shortcut profiles made for v1.0 will not work for previous versions, and vice versa.\\n- While user interface layouts are technically compatible between 0.x and 1.0 versions, it\'s recommended to remove the old layouts (if you have made any) and make them again in v1.0, as they may not appear correctly, due to the fact that v1.0 has new panels.\\n\\n## Command Line Interface\\nPixelorama now has its own basic Command Line Interface, which allows you to do stuff such as exporting your projects, from the command line. This is very helpful for automating tasks.\\n\\n## Full changelog:\\nThe changes described above are just the tip of the iceburg! There are so many more additions, improvements and fixes that are coming in version 1.0:\\n\\n### Added\\n- Multiple layer blend modes are finally here! Note that group blending is not currently supported. [#911](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/911)\\n- Non-destructive layer effects have been implemented. [#940](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/940)\\n- A new curve tool has been implemented. It contains a \\"fill shape\\" tool option, allowing it to be used as a polygon tool as well. [#1019](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1019)\\n- [Pixelorama is now available on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170). Consider purchasing on Steam as a way to support the development of the project, and getting benefits such as automatic updates and even Steam Achievements!\\n- An extension explorer has been integrated into Pixelorama, allowing for easy extension downloading from the internet. [#910](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/910)\\n- Export to video formats. FFMPEG is required to be installed in the device in order for video exporting to work. [#980](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/980)\\n- Importing video formats and gif files is also possible, but FFMPEG is again required for this.\\n- Basic clipping mask functionality has been implemented. Enabling clipping mask on a layer will use the layer directly below it as the mask. Note that right now group layers cannot be used as masks.\\n- Alpha lock has been added as a global tool option. When enabled, users can only draw on non-transparent pixels.\\n- Export to webp and jpeg file formats. Webp is currently only for static images and does not support animations.\\n- A basic Command Line Interface has been implemented, to help with automating mass project file exporting. [#579](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/579)\\n- A 64-bit ARM build is now also available along with the 32-bit ARM build.\\n- Dragging and dropping multiple frames or layers to re-arrange them is now (finally!) supported, instead of only moving the last layer/frame selected.\\n- Users can now create new tags from the frame right-click menu, by clicking on \\"New Tag\\".\\n- It is now possible to edit a tag\'s properties by clicking on its name from the timeline, and to move and resize it by dragging its edges.\\n- Users can now resize the timeline\'s cel size from the timeline settings, which used to be onion skinning settings.\\n- Exporting the project\'s data to a separate JSON file is now possible from the export dialog.\\n- Native file dialogs are now supported and can be enabled from the Preferences!\\n- Dialog popups can now be native OS windows instead of embedded within Pixelorama\'s main window. This can be changed from the Preferences.\\n- Added some missing shortcuts for buttons. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- Palette colors can now be sorted.\\n- Added new Pixelize and Palettize effects. Pixelize makes the image pixelated, and Palettize maps the color of the input to the nearest color in the selected palette. Useful for limiting color in pixel art and for artistic effects. Can also act as a workaround for the current lack of a proper indexed mode.\\n- Exporting each layer as a different file is now possible.\\n- The bucket tool now supports filling while the mouse is moving and the button is still being held.\\n- A new boot splash image is being shown when Pixelorama is loading, instead of a gray color.\\n- The brush increment/decrement shortcuts can now be changed. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- Changing layers is now possible with keyboard shortcuts (Control + Up/Down arrow keys by default).\\n- A \\"Crop to Selection\\" option has been added to the Image menu, that crops the image based on the active selection.\\n- A stabilizer for smoother drawing has been implemented.\\n- Users can now add custom data in the form of text in their projects, layers, frames, tags and cels.\\n- Image brushes can now be flipped and rotated with 90 degree steps in the tool options. [#988](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/988)\\n- Added support for inverted tablet pens. [#966](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/966)\\n- Added new dialogs for cel, layer and project properties. Cel and layer which can be accessed by right-clicking cel and the layer buttons in the timeline respectively, while project properties can be found under the Image menu.\\n- A new z-index property has been added to the cel properties, allowing for independent, per-frame layer ordering.\\n- Dragging and dropping images directly from a Web browser into Pixelorama is now possible! Note that this may not work with all browsers.\\n- Pasting tags from other projects is now possible. [#946](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/946)\\n- A new \\"Pixelorama\\" palette has been added to the default palettes.\\n- <kbd>Control + Shift + T</kbd> has been added as a default shortcut that opens the last project.\\n- Imported `.gpl` palettes now take into account their \\"Columns\\" field. [#1025](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1025)\\n- \\"Snap to\\" settings from the View menu are now being remembered between sessions.\\n- The step of the zoom and rotation canvas sliders can now be snapped, to 100 and 45 respectively.\\n- It is now possible to change the color space of gradients from sRGB, which is the default, to Linear sRGB and Oklab.\\n- 3D layers now support torus shapes. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- Image effect animation now supports the tweening transition method of spring. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- Added a new Rose theme.\\n\\n### Changed\\n- The file format of pxo files has been changed. Pxo files are now zip files in disguise. [#952](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/952)\\n- Similarly, the file format of Pixelorama\'s palette files has been changed from .tres back to .json as they used to be in the past. This change had to happen due to [security concerns regarding Godot\'s resource files](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/4925). [#967](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/967)\\n- Changes made to the User Interface layouts are now automatically being saved. To restore a default layout, users can go to Window > Manage Layouts > Add and select from one of the default layouts.\\n- Pixelorama\'s icon has changed.\\n- The config file has been renamed from \\"cache.ini\\" to \\"config.ini\\". This effectively means that preferences edited in v0.x will not be automatically be carried over to v1.0.\\n- The colors of the themes has been limited and grouped to allow for easier theming, using this [new stand-alone tool](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/PixeloramaThemeCreator).\\n- The color picker is now always visible in the user interface as its own panel, instead of being a popup. The previous color buttons have been re-purposed to allow for setting whether the color being selected is for the left or the right tool.\\n- The color pickers has been vastly improved, thanks to the update to Godot 4. Users can now use the OKHSL color mode, and choose between four different picker shapes: HSV Rectangle (default), HSV Wheel, VHS Circle and OKHSL Circle.\\n- The opacity slider in the timeline now affects layer opacity and not cel opacity. Cel opacity has been moved to the cel properties dialog.\\n- Bucket tool\'s \\"similar colors\\" mode now changes the same color in all selected cels, acting as a color replace for multiple cels.\\n- The timeline\'s UI has been changed to better indicate which cels are selected and improves on how child layers of groups are being shown.\\n- The onion skinning settings has been changed into general timeline settings.\\n- Cel-specific effects have been moved from the Image menu into the new Effects menu.\\n- Linked cels no longer have a colored outline, they now have a rectangle behind their preview which makes linked cels look like they are chained together.\\n- \\"Crop Image\\" has been renamed to \\"Crop to Content\\".\\n- Imported images automatically become new projects without opening the import dialog, if there is only one project open, and that project is empty.\\n- Window opacity is disabled by default to improve performance, but it can be enabled in the Preferences.\\n- Reference images have received some nice improvements, including undo/redo and easy transformations directly on the canvas. [#961](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/961)\\n- The add/remove swatch color buttons have been moved to the same horizontal container as the palette select and add/edit palette buttons, allowing for Inkscape-like horizontal placement of the palette panel, without any wasted space.\\n- Cel buttons now hide their transparent background when their corresponding cels are empty, instead of just dimming them.\\n- Every shader-based image effect is automatically working without the need to change renderers, and they all work now on the Web version. This comes at the cost of less compatibility, as the desktop version now requires OpenGL 3.3 minimum instead of 2.1, and the Web version requires WebGL 2 instead of WebGL 1. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- The dynamics popup only show the relevant properties to which dynamics are currently toggled on.\\n- When attempting to enable an extension, a confirmation dialog appears, as an extra security step.\\n- The aspect ratio button in the Scale Image dialog is toggled on by default.\\n- Negative values in shading tool options are now allowed. [#1015](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/1015)\\n- If \\"Include frame tags in the file name\\" is enabled in the export window, the tag name is included even when exporting a single file.\\n- When deleting an extension, a confirmation window now appears that lets users either to delete the palette permanently, move it to trash, or cancel. [#919](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/919)\\n- \\"Developers\\" and \\"Contributors\\" have been merged into \\"Authors\\" in the About dialog. \\"Donate\\" has also been removed from there, and a new \\"Support Pixelorama\'s Development\\" option has been added to the Help menu.\\n\\n### Fixed\\n- There should be less crashes overall. 0.x versions crashed randomly on some devices, probably due to how Godot 3 handled memory management for images, but 1.0 no longer seems to cause these crashes.\\n- Performance when drawing and doing operations such as bucket area fill should be better now. [#900](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/900)\\n- Selections now scale properly when they are not transforming any image content. [#774](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/774)\\n- The aspect ratio is now being kept correctly in image effect dialog previews.\\n- Dividing by zero in value sliders and spinboxes no longer crashes the program.\\n- Default palettes are now available for clean installs on macOS. [#1008](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1008)\\n- When drawing, the focus of other GUI elements of the application now gets released. This prevents behaviors such as switching the focus of GUI elements with, for example, the arrow keys while moving the canvas or an active selection with the arrow keys.\\n- The canvas no longer remains in the drag state when the mouse it outside of it. Meaning, if the middle mouse button or space is being pressed to drag the canvas, and the mouse gets out of the canvas while the button is still pressed and then it is released, when the mouse re-enters the canvas, it is no longer being dragged.\\n- Pixelorama no longer quits when saving from the File menu, if the user attempted to save on exit before and cancelled the save file dialog.\\n- The delete layer button is now immediately disabled when locking a layer, thus preventing the user from being able to delete a locked layer.\\n- Fixed a bug where the exported files had the wrong tag name, if \\"Include frame tags in the file name\\" was enabled.\\n- The text of the rulers is now being properly clipped. [#1023](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/1023)\\n\\n### Removed\\n- BubbleGum16, Complementary, Monochromatic, Shades and Triad palettes have been removed from the default palettes.\\n- The frame tag button has been removed from the timeline.\\n- It is no longer possible to change the renderer from the Preferences, as GLES3 is now the only option.\\n\\n## The Future of Pixelorama\\nI have many more ideas for Pixelorama that I want to work on and implement for the future. But that future depends on you. As a free and open source project, we need and rely on your support, so if you like what you see, please consider supporting us so we can keep working on the project we love. Here are some ideas that I have for future versions. Note that it\'s not 100% certain when and if these will be implemented, but I will do my best!\\n- Indexed mode.\\n- Tilemap layers.\\n- Vector layers, for non-destructive shape editing and text editing.\\n- An Android version.\\n- Animated layer effects, with support for custom shader loading.\\n- A more powerful brush system, perhaps giving the ability for users to create their own code-based brushes instead of just images.\\n- More love for the 3D layers, such as the ability to edit an object\'s material, and load and export GLTF files.\\n- Performance improvements, especially for operations that affect a large number of pixels. Some of the algorithms we use may have to be re-written in C++.\\n- The ability to rotate and skew selections directly with gizmos.\\n- Make the shading tool have a mode that takes darker and lighter colors from the palette.\\n- Color curves and brightness/contrast adjusting.\\n- Save gradients so that they can be re-used easily, and give the options to users to add their own dithering matrices.\\n\\n\\nThank you all for taking the time to read this blog post and for supporting us. We appreciate every and each one of you, with special thanks to our contributors, our translators and our [patrons](https://www.patreon.com/OramaInteractive)!
